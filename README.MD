## About the Game
**PyQuest** is an educational game designed to enhance cognitive skills and concentration through engaging gameplay. Players navigate through levels, facing AI-generated multiple-choice questions on Python programming whenever they encounter certain obstacles. By gamifying learning, PyQuest aims to balance education with entertainment, addressing issues like gaming addiction and lack of academic motivation.

## Technologies Used
